For the final project I would like to build a personal website. There will be 3 html pages: About me, a listing of my projects and a 'professional experiences' page which will essentially be a stylized CV. I am also considering extending the website with a contact me page that would send me an automated email. For the projects page I am planning to add a comments section that will use POST/GET requests and MongoDB storage of the existing comments. Some of the CV/projects data will be saved as json files which will have to be loaded using fetch commands. 


Frontend: HTML/CSS

Use classes and ids
Use display: flex;
Include a CSS animation or transition
Change 2+ default font properties
Change 2+ box model properties (border, padding, margin)

Frontend: JavaScript
Write object-oriented JavaScript
Include 2+ ES6 classes
Use at least one callback or Custom Event to communicate between classes
Listen for 2+ events
Use fetch() to talk to your backend

Backend
Use Node and ExpressJS
Save persistent data in some way using either MongoDB or a Google spreadsheet
We encourage you to use a MongoDB backend
Include at least 1 GET route
Include at least 1 POST route, and it should include a message body
Include at least one route parameter

Use async / await properly somewhere in your project.
This can be in the frontend, backend, or both.
