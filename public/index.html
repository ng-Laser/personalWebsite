			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
			Hello! My name is Noa Glaser and I am a rising senior in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science co-term at Stanford University. I feel lucky to attend Stanford and meet the incredible people here, as well as take really cool classes such as CS 193X: Web Programming Fundamentals. I found this class incredibly empowering. I entered the course frustrated after rage-inducing attempts at a personal website through the stochastic coding + StackOverflow. The frameworks and concepts taught at CS193X cleared things up so quickly and taught me exactly what I wanted to know. I hope you enjoy this first iteration of my personal website.
