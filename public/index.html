			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
			Hello! My name is Noa Glaser. I am a masters (co-term) student in Computer Science at Stanford University and rising senior in Electrical Engineering. I feel fortunate to attend such an incredible institution and to study from leading researchers in my fields of interest.</p><p>
			Academically, I am interested in Computer Vision/Imaging, Robotics and Unmanned Vehicles, and AI. I hope to work on products with great social impact. My dream job is leading an R&D department and I strive to gain academic and engineering excellence and broad view of potential impact for cutting-edge technology on our world.</p><p>
			I have developed my skills through internships at Facebook Building 8, Goldman Sachs (Investment Banking Division - Strats), research at Stanford and Harvard Wyss Institute, and the Research Science Institute at MIT. I am excited because I still have so much to learn.</p><p>
			I speak English and Hebrew well, Spanish poorly, and can pretend to understand Russian. I am always looking for patient language buddies, folks who love social dance, and people with strong opinions about movies.
